# Data-Science
This is the beginning of my scientific initiation on hate speech identification.

First week:
  I made an programm that get submissions and comments from an subreddit.
  
Second week:
  I improved the project, splitting the program in two: submissions and comments, so became easier to collect more data. Also, I collected the informations of 26 subreddits this time.

Third week:
  This week was just a study of good programming practices, in which I comment correctly on my script and turn it in something more scalable.
