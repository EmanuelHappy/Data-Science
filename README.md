First week:
  I made an programm that get submissions and comments from an subreddit.
  
Second week:
<<<<<<< HEAD
  I improved the project, splitting the program in two: submissions and comments, so became easier to collect more data. Also, I collected the informations of 26 subreddits this time.

Third week:

   I upgraded the programm, so it can get informantions from a list of subreddits
