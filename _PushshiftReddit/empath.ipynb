    "a = lexicon.analyze(\"I knew that boys above a certain age have the worst chances of finding adoptive parents but I had no idea it was as bad as you describe. \\n\\nAlas, yes. Basically if a boy gets put into the system at anything above age 8... he's gonna get screwed over and screwed up BIG TIME.\\n\\nOnce they reach 12 or 13... they KNOW that basically \\\"no one wants them\\\" (even though that is not REALLY true; it is true in that the system is set up to create that effect) and they KNOW that the system has no place for them and is rigged against them in terms of ever having a family or a permanent home... they even get formally put on a \\\"path\\\" towards independent living (aging out of the system) by around age 14-15, and its pretty much already preordained by the time they hit age 10 or 11.\\n\\nGo over to /r/fosterit if you dare -- one horror story after another (being bounced from one foster home or group home to another, and back again -- often 3 or 4 within a year, and on average probably close to a dozen by the time they are 18) abound -- what is amazing is that SOME of the kids actually manage to survive and prosper despite all the shit tossed at them. \\n\\nAnd then that is not even to mention the modern penchant to just drug them into a zombie state (with just about every prescription psychoactive med on the market -- see a diagnosis of ADHD or ADD etc means the kid is now a \\\"special needs\\\" child, and the state agency gets extra money from the federal government for them; plus the foster family gets larger checks to care for them -- the incentives are all economically \\\"perverse\\\"). There was a whole series on TV about this a while back, IIRC it was by Diane Sawyer/ABC.\\n\\nPlus, despite what the system is SUPPOSED to do -- there is in reality NO ONE on the kid's side arguing that his \\\"behavioral problems\\\" are NOT due to some brain disorder, but well... HELL, I mean if you were ripped out of your home &amp; neighborhood and shuffled around like so much worthless flea-ridden baggage, wouldn't YOU have \\\"behavioral\\\" episodes too?  Not to mention that a lot of them were abused in their original homes and suffer a variety of abuses in their foster &amp; group homes, plus they are perennially the \\\"new\\\" and \\\"weird\\\" and \\\"poor\\\" kid in school after school, neighborhood after neighborhood, etc. ANY ONE of those things would be \\\"crazy-making\\\", add them all together...)\\n\\n&gt;A friend of mine was in foster care from the age of 6 until adulthood and it's left him as a troubled and dysfunctional adult. He's unemployed, uses drugs, is banned from driving and has been in trouble with the police on numerous occasions. To top it off he has a teenaged daughter he's not allowed to see, \\n\\nAlas, but from what I learned about the outcomes and statistics, that is a pretty much a \\\"standard\\\" fate.\\n\\nOur prisons are full of them. (Stats on recidivists are pretty sad... lots of ex-foster kids.)\\n\\nLikewise with teen moms &amp; single moms, the rate of foster-girls (often with absentee foster-boy fathers) is ridiculously high as well -- so the cycle repeats and grows; and even more children get a shitty home life and suffer &amp; struggle the rest of their life as well -- and the system is really only exacerbating the problem.\\n\\n&gt;and is strugging with coming to terms with his (bi-)sexuality, finding no support from his community, what remains of his family or the LGBTWTFBBQ types who only seem interested in supporting gay men if they're willing to castrate themselves and sacrifice their masculinity upon the altar of feminism. He often talks about suicide and worrying about him is part of the reason I started thinking about this subject.\\n\\nWell, see *now that he is an ADULT MALE,* the system sees him as one of the \\\"oppressors\\\", so why should be be given sympathy? (He's just another \\\"deadbeat dad\\\" to be BLAMED for the problems of his children...)\\n\\n\\n&gt;RE: LGBTWTFBBQ types who only seem interested in supporting gay men if they're willing to castrate themselves and sacrifice their masculinity upon the altar of feminism\\n\\n**Well, just remember, you said that not me.  ;-)**\\n\\n&gt;Have you ever considered how your experiences becoming a foster/adoptive parent might have differed if you were in a civil union with a platonic male friend? I could see this going either way: in one scenario, the social workers, aware of your unorthadox union become doubly suspicious of your intentions causing you to face even more scrutiny and prejudice. On the other hand, I could see couples who are genuinely committed to each other potentially breaking new legal ground if they were willing to take their fight to the press and high courts. Who's to say what can legally be defined as \\\"love\\\" - is it a sexual relationship or is fraternity and friendship sufficient? With the recent legitimising of all kinds of non-traditional families, it doesn't seem so crazy to think that this might be possible.\\n\\nBelieve it or not, somewhat of THAT scenario was actually almost suggested (again, \\\"off the record\\\") by the soon-to-retire DCFS guy.  Initially he said something to the tune of: *\\\"You know if you were 1/2 of a gay couple you would stand a better chance of being able to foster/adopt; because the female social workers don't see 'gay' men as threatening...\\\"* (CF back to your comment about castrating LGBTWTFBBQ types).\\n\\nThe thing is he wasn't really suggesting (as you are) a *platonic* no-homo civil-union though, he was still pushing the *\\\"You MUST just be an 'in the closet' homo, so why not 'come out' get a gay partner, etc and THEN try fostering/adopting...\\\"* meme. (Because again, apparently it is now -- due to the feminist BS -- assumed to scientifically-proven thing that hetero males {aka rapists} CANNOT have any inherent parental desires or abilities... *married* hetero males have apparently just been \\\"trained\\\" and/or tied down and \\\"pussy whipped\\\" like subservient dogs by their wives into taking on occasional pseudo nurturing roles in the form of \\\"chores\\\" in order to get the occasional access to the stretched out Vag.)\\n\\nI mean what do you SAY to that kind of crap?  \\n\\nI was just all *\\\"Dude, being 'gay' is NOT a choice!  I can't just 'decide' to change my sexual orientation; that just ISN'T an option.\\\"* (I seriously think -- given his age -- he was still in some warped \\\"Freudian\\\" 1960's style mindset regarding sexual orientation.)\\n\\nI mean I understand what you are saying/proposing... but I think an easier way would just be to do an \\\"adult adoption\\\" and mentoring of some 18+ year old orphan kid.  \\n\\nOf course by then you are trying to do \\\"reparative\\\" work as a friend/mentor one adult to another, rather than any actual \\\"parenting\\\"; and there is the additional problem that you're probably going to end up just facilitating a co-dependent prolonged adolescence/irresponsibility rather than really helping them to grow up.\\n\\nAnd regardless that doesn't do anything to help any of the kids trapped in the bizarro-world of the foster-care system.\\n\\n&gt;Beyond adoption, a small number of places in the world, including California and Russia, allow commercial surrogacy, where even a single man can become the sole parent of a child by paying to \\\"rent a womb\\\".\\n\\nYeah... and again... $urrogate$ are expen$ive (rent-a-womb is really just another form of gold-digging).\\n\\nIt would probably be easier just to go abroad and find some non-American-Princess foreign chick to be a brood mother. After all, now that my beard has gone white I am increasingly resembling the Dos Equis \\\"Most Interesting Man in the World\\\" guy. \\n\\nIf it weren't for family commitments (aging parents) I could easily move overseas and live like the **Patriarch-king** I am constantly labeled as wanting to be anyway -- the smaller Asian/Filipino gals have always looked pretty good to me, and as long as they could be kept away from the influence of the gold-digging American Feminazi biotches, well... heck, keep 'em barefoot &amp; pregnant and in the kitchen and they'll probably be really quite content.\\n\\n;-)\\n\\n&gt;Admittedly - this does nothing to help the scores of boys in foster care desperately needing adoptive parents - but a heterosexual male couple in a legal union with an established family might fare better with social workers.\\n\\nThis is the part that pissed (and still pisses) me off.\\n\\nThose particular boys are being fucked over by people with entirely perverse agenda -- despite all the superficial claims the system really DOESN'T give a shit about them.  Perfectly good young men -- a lot of them doubtless with great potential -- are being treated almost as badly as feral cats.\\n\\nAnd I know I couldn't do more than help maybe one or two... but to be categorically PREVENTED from even trying.  :'(\\n\\nI've basically just had to harden my heart and turn away from the whole thing and say to myself like a mantra: *\\\"They're not MY kids. It's NOT my fault that I am be prevented from helping them.\\\"*\\n\\nAnd then only occasionally (like when I see a post like yours) does it all well up inside me again... and I have to deal.  *And It Fucking Sux!*\\n\\n\\n&gt;Thanks again for your insight and I understand why you would post with a burner account; I myself have a separate login just for men's rights issues as it is a very taboo subject.\\n\\nYeah... feminist/matriarchal societies tend to implode, collapse and die.  \\n\\n*But you are NOT allowed to say that (especially because it is true\")\n",
